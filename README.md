### Holberton project

This project closes the first trimester of the year spent at Holberton, and allows us to apply all the concepts we have seen so far.

The shell is a program that receives commands given by a user from his keyboard and sends them to the operating system, which will then execute them.

Our task was to reproduce the Bourne shell's (sh) behavior.

in collaboration with [Simon](https://github.com/SimonBr017 "GitHub") for Holberton projects.
